# N-Queen Genetic Algorithm

Solution by evolutionary algorithm.

In each generation the algorithm selects the better half of the individuals from the previous generation to carry over the next generation.

From these individuals 2 parents are selected randomly and the offspring is created by crossing over the parents.
If the parents have common genes, the offspring will likely have the same genes. The rest of the genes are generated randomly.
